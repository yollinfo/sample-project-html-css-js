- __/assests__: A folder for storing images, icons, or any other assets required for the project.

## üìù Usage
This template is designed to save time setting up a basic project, allowing you to focus on writing code and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can either use GitHub Codespaces to start coding directly in the cloud or clone the repository to your local machine.
